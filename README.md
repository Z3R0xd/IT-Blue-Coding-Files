This is the main repository for our coding files, feel free to use the zipped files for preview and use.

During this period we learned a lot of coding methods and contributed a lot towards our development towards improving our coding skills.

It is recommended that you download the zip files and try out the code, since some HTML code require certain dependancies that the zip files have.

Our work can be seen in the "Working Files" folder contained in each zipped folder.

Personal Note :
This is for a school project, there will be no furhter updates to this thread.
